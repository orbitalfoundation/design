## OVERVIEW

Web browsers define an architecture that mediates our interactions with each other. Here we walk through some of the concerns browsers have, and this work has, going from narrow to large.

### Pragmatics

In a narrow technical sense we see this work as pragmatic - involving the following:

1. A microkernel approach; to push apps and services out of a browser core (including HTML)
2. Package signing formalisms for security (similar to any app store)
3. Formal and new persistence API's for web apps to talk to (to replace PWA localstorage).
4. A client side in-browser "desktop" for browsing one's one browser apps and data.
5. Small apps that showcase the thesis
6. Building on existing tools such as Rust/Cargo
7. Systems to allow multiple apps to render to the same scene graph and filter their traffic.

### Down the road

Beyond this, nice to haves down the road may include:

1. Public/private key based identity built in - no more logins or signups.
2. An emphasis on built in trust graph generation; building direct relationships and networks
3. An emphasis on aggregation built in -> collect for you rather than you go to a site
4. Support for Solid, DWEB, IPFS, Metamask and other emerging technologies.

### Web Browsers as OS

In the broader sense a web browser is situated in a stack of services - but we do want to avoid attempting to build FirefoxOS. We see this work situated like so:

1. The Internet
2. Web Browsers themselves
3. App Stores (which today are the way people receive apps)
4. Desktops (increasingly shallow)
5. Operating Systems (increasingly locked down)
6. Hardware

### Looking at Societal Implications

Beyond the technicals, we see any technology as potentially having huge impacts on user lives. We want to be sensitive to how our tools change us, and how tools "fit" us - what they make us into - what they encourage or discourage in us.

Conceptually a web browser is often thought of as a "user agent" - a proxy or extension of user will. But we take a slightly different and more prosocial stance on this. We see the web as an ecosystem with many players, and we're interested in how to keep that system rich, healthy and full of diversity.

Here are some of the positions we're taking in this work:

1. We want our software to act on behalf of the user, mediating their interactions with the world.
2. We want to be focused on a healthy internet that encourages sincere discourse and engagement around real issues.
3. We want to encourage each user to aggregate content themselves rather than going to content silos to consume media.
4. We believe the user device can build up semantic models of the world; in a sense a personal Wikipedia or enumeration of kinds of artifacts in the world.
5. Make it very easy for buyers and sellers to know each other (better align market incentives).
6. Embed and support digital currency wallets and keep testing a variety of ways for artists to actually be able to directly sustain their work.
7. Help users audit and score the content based on social trust graph analysis such as Keybase or PGP provide.

### Challenges

It's also important to recognize there are many concerns and issues, and we can only solve a few. Even more broadly these are some of the issues that face us in trying to communicate across billions of minds in a burgeoning planetary civilization:

1. ADVERTISING. The web is relying heavily on advertising because of challenges in letting people pay for individual purchases.
2. TRUST. It's hard to know what and who is real because of weak identity models on the web.
3. DDOS. It's too easy to perform distributed denial of service attacks to shut down websites.
4. INEQUALITY. Many people just don't have access to the same Internet we have here in the west.
5. PASSIVE CONSUMPTION. It's too easy to just consume content; and perhaps a bit too hard to create content.
6. CENTRALIZATION. Content is becoming centralized by gatekeepers who can then exert undue pressure and control.
7. DISCOVERY. It can be hard to find good content, apps and experiences.

### Defining Success

Success for us would  mean that:

1. 3d working interfaces start to replace the 2d desktop paradigm
2. people who cannot see or hear or who have other traits can also be empowered
3. applications become delivered over the web rather than through walled garden app stores
4. data becomes more first class; less locked into silos
5. social content websites become just another way to consume social media rather than the only way
6. that people come to trust their orb as a proxy for their will; that it fairly represents them and helps them in their daily business
