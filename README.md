We're exploring the future of web interfaces. Join us!

Our goal is to provide the web with the same kind of rich app persistence and performance that we're used to with native desktop applications. We're leveraging Servo, Rust, Cargo and other tools to help provide users with a user agent that can persistently engage the world on their behalf. We're interested in fostering a healthy ecosystem for all participants, where users can directly engage with content creators and publishers and where content can be aggregated, filtered and scored against trust graphs, and where multiple applications can paint to the same view. Our focus is the future of the web with an emphasis on 3D and AR enhanced views of reality.
